			<h2>Ana Acu単a</h2>
				<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p>Ana was born in Mayag端ez, Puerto Rico, quite the change from Rochester, NY. Evidently there is actually sun in Puerto, contrary to the frozen hell that is Rochester most of the year. During her younger years, Ana spent a lot of time at the campus which her parents both worked, thus helping her drive to be a stellar student, eventually winding up at the University of Rochester.</p>
				<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>Ana is presently the President of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, as well as having served time as the Financial Vice President of GPB. This has been a major plus to her time at UR because joining a sorority served as a means for meeting many new people, some being her closest friends today.</p>
				<h3>Major</h3>
					<p>After shuffling around with a few different majors, Ana finally settled on majoring in Business, namely Marketing. She feels that this is the best fit for her right now and that it sparked her journey to reach out and actually find out where her interests lie.</p>

				<p>Kat Fuss has forever been a resident of Rochester, having attended gradeschool here and classes suited to her aptitude for hands on, practical art-based opportunities, which led to her developing a taste for theatre and other art-based technicalities.</p>
			<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>Kat has developed an interest in theatre through her exploits in high school, as well as an interst in CAD and PhotoShop, which she claims is what sparked her interest in the DMS major, and is something that she sees as having practical value in the real world.</p>

				<p>Kat is presently a junior hoping to graduate in 2021 with a BA in DMS and a minor in Spanish. Kat is taking classes this semester in particular which are outside her usual field of study, such as The Art of Film and Modern Architecture, but offer a means of opening her eyes to the full spectrum of DMS as a whole.</p>
