# Design
I utilized a Z-pattern on the home page to draw the user to click on the "students" link. On the students page I use an F-pattern. I use a similar color scheme when discussing the similarities between the two students and the information of the two students. Then I use a completely different background color for the student that is different. I also have a small seperation and a black line between the students who have something in common and the student that is different.
