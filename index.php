			<h2>Ana Acu単a</h2>
				<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p>Ana was born in Mayag端ez, Puerto Rico, quite the change from Rochester, NY. Evidently there is actually sun in Puerto, contrary to the frozen hell that is Rochester most of the year. During her younger years, Ana spent a lot of time at the campus which her parents both worked, thus helping her drive to be a stellar student, eventually winding up at the University of Rochester.</p>
				<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>Ana is presently the President of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, as well as having served time as the Financial Vice President of GPB. This has been a major plus to her time at UR because joining a sorority served as a means for meeting many new people, some being her closest friends today.</p>
				<h3>Major</h3>
					<p>After shuffling around with a few different majors, Ana finally settled on majoring in Business, namely Marketing. She feels that this is the best fit for her right now and that it sparked her journey to reach out and actually find out where her interests lie.</p>
